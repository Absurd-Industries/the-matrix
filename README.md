# Welcome to The Matrix! #

There are two possible modes for The Matrix

- Text Mode

## Animation Mode ##

Animation mode supports 8-bit keyframe animations. Use the pre-defined templates or animate your own on, https://xantorohara.github.io/led-matrix-editor/

Excpetionally useful and very intuitive.
